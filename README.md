Hello, human

I'm an alien, visiting the world of code and tech on a journey that will probably take the rest of my life.

Recent world events shook me loose from the relitive peace of the art-market. My technical role in such an digitally unsophisticated feild has left me ill prepared to embark on this journey. 

Peace!
